# Mini Cms

The Mini Cms v 0.7 beta is not a stable release, it's only for testing.
I'm testing and improving it, if you want to help me download the release and try it on your host.

Simply put all files in a folder on your host and go to it with your browser, Mini Cms will ask you all the information it needs.
If you catch a bug or if you have some suggestion, open an issue.

Thank you.
